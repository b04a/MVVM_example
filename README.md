# MVVM_example

Today I've been working on the MVVM architecture
(Model View ViewModel)

1) Model - like everywhere else, business logic
2) View - (ViewController), the main logic of the application
3) ModelView - it stores the updates and interlinks between the View and Model.

That is, ViewController receives the change and passes it through ViewModel, and it in turn receives Model.
